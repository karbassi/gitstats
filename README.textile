h1. gitstats

_gitstats_ is a statistics generator for git repositories. It is mostly intended
for developers, as a way to check some development statistics for a project.

Currently it produces only HTML output with tables and graphs.

h2. Requirements

* Python (>= 2.4.4)
* Git (>= 1.5.2.4)
* Gnuplot (>= 4.0.0)
* a git repository (bare clone will work as well)

The above versions are not absolute requirements; older versions may work also.

h2. Recommended

* Lots of memory and fast disk for large projects

h2. Contributions

Patches should be sent under "GPLv2 or older" license - this will allow
upgrading to newer GPL versions if they are sensible.

h2. Installation

_gitstats_ does not currently need to be installed; it's used right from the
directory (it also assumes some files like the stylesheet are in .)

Suppose you have a git project at @/mnt/src/git/project@
and you want to save the statistics to @~/public_html/project@

You would run:

bq. $ ./gitstats /mnt/src/git/project ~/public_html/project

(go grab a cup of coffee if it's a large project :)

bq. $ sensible-browser ~/public_html/project/index.html
